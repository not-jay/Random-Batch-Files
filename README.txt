Just drag the drive's shortcut (the one in 'My Computer')
or any of the files in the drive, and it should fix/clean
the USB (or the drive of the file) shortcut virus! :)

Be careful though, running it accidentally
might 'attrib' your whole "C:\" drive!

You can also run it's commandline version with
fixusb <drive letter>:
